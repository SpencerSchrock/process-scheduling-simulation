## Synopsis

This project was written as a homework assignment for a data structure class at Penn State. It gives a basic insight into different policies used to manage processes and other resources such as the network and disk. 
Each policy usually implemented its own data structure. For example, a queue implemented a linked list, whereas priority scheduling used a heap.

## Installation
